Working:

Task 1: Generating Camera Rays (15 pts)
Task 2: Ray-Triangle Intersection (22 pts)
Task 3: BVH intersection (30 pts)
Task 4: Shadow Rays (10 pts)
Task 6: Perfect Mirror Reflection (15 pts)
Ray-Sphere intersection (1 pt, descried in Task 2)
Task 5: Global illumination path tracing with Russian roulette (6 pts)
Transmissive surfaces, w/ transmission given by the Fresnel equations) (4 pts, described in Task 6)
EXTRA: emitted light reflected on reflective objects but not others.

Broken:

There is a bug in the BVH flat BBox intersection that causes some false positive,
leading to dark regions. To avoid it,  BVH<Primitive>::hit disables BVH acceleration for now.
